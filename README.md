# 🌿 Plant Disease Prediction using CNN

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a Deep Learning-based image classification system to detect plant diseases from leaf images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

The model is trained to classify plant leaves into healthy and diseased categories, helping farmers and agricultural professionals detect diseases early and reduce crop loss.
